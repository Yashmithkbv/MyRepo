Use Modern ES6+ Features

Prefer const, let, arrow functions, and template literals over var and old-style function expressions.

Use @track Only When Necessary

Modern LWC reactivity removes the need for @track in most cases. Use normal properties instead.

Avoid this.template.querySelector for DOM Manipulation

Use getter methods and dynamic properties instead of directly modifying the DOM.

Use @api, @track, and @wire Correctly

@api for public properties, @wire for data fetching, and avoid modifying wired properties directly.

Remove console.log Statements Before Deployment

Use proper debugging tools instead of leaving console.log in production code.
