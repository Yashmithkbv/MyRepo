Bulkify Your Code: Ensure your code can handle multiple records simultaneously, not just single instances. This approach prevents hitting governor limits when processing large datasets. For example, iterate over all records in Trigger.new rather than processing only the first record. ​

Avoid SOQL Queries or DML Statements Inside Loops: Placing queries or data manipulation operations within loops can quickly exceed Salesforce's governor limits. Instead, accumulate data in collections and perform operations outside the loop to optimize performance. ​

Use Collections to Store Data: Utilize lists, sets, and maps to store data retrieved from queries. This practice reduces the number of queries and DML operations, aiding in efficient resource utilization.​

Implement Proper Exception Handling: Use try-catch blocks to manage exceptions gracefully. This ensures that errors are handled appropriately without disrupting the user experience.​

Write Comprehensive Unit Tests: Develop unit tests that cover as many lines of code as possible. Salesforce requires at least 75% code coverage for deployment, and thorough testing helps identify and fix issues early. ​
Salesforce Developers

Avoid Hardcoding IDs: Hardcoding record IDs can lead to issues when deploying across different environments. Instead, query for the necessary IDs dynamically to ensure flexibility and maintainability. ​
Salesforce Developers

Adhere to the KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Write clear and concise code. Simplifying complex logic enhances readability and maintainability, making it easier for others to understand and modify your code. ​
Salesforce Developers

Use Custom Settings and Metadata: Store configuration data in custom settings or custom metadata types instead of hardcoding values. This approach allows for easier adjustments without modifying the codebase.​

Leverage Platform Features: Utilize Salesforce's built-in features and declarative tools whenever possible before resorting to custom code. This strategy reduces complexity and leverages the platform's optimized functionalities.​

Document Your Code: Provide clear comments and documentation for your code to explain its purpose and functionality. Well-documented code facilitates collaboration and future maintenance.
